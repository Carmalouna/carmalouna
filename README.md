### 2. Project Overview

This web application serves as a comprehensive platform for users to book and participate in yoga classes and coaching sessions. It enables users to join live online yoga sessions through video conferencing platforms like Teams or Zoom, providing flexibility to attend from anywhere. The app also offers a library of pre-recorded yoga workout videos for users who prefer practicing on their own schedule.

Personalized coaching sessions are available, focusing on specific wellness topics like stress management, mindfulness, and flexibility. These sessions cater to individual needs, ensuring a tailored approach to each user’s journey.

New coaches or trainers can join the platform by going through a verification process. Once verified, they can manage classes and offer their expertise. In addition, coaches can sign up for predefined classes available on the platform. If a coach has qualifications for types of courses not yet offered, they can add these to the platform, expanding the range of classes available.

Users can join a vibrant community by creating an account, with options for a free plan (potentially ad-supported) or an upgraded subscription. The subscription plan includes a credit system—users receive a set number of credits each month (e.g., 50 credits) that they can use for various activities like watching videos (1 credit), joining group classes (3 credits), or booking private sessions (5 credits). Private sessions are only accessible with the paid version.
